For those stuck installing mysql on the sandboxes, I think this works:

install sudo:
    apt install sudo

update apt:
    sudo apt update

Install mysql:
    sudo apt install mysql-server

There are errors. Ignore them.

start the service:
    sudo service mysql start

There are errors. Ignore them.

launch mysql:
    sudo mysql

You're going to see a bunch of errors, but at the end of the day "show databases" works.
