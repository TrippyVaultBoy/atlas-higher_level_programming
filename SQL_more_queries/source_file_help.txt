if anyone has any problem downloading the source files for 10+ on proj 2 here are the steps:
 1. Log into mysql
    
    mysql -u root -p
 
 2. Create the database hbtn_0d_tvshows
    
    CREATE database hbtn_0d_tvshows
 
 3. Exit mysql, and run the following command (replace URL with the project dump file URL)
    
    curl -O <url>
 
 4. Now just plug the downloaded dump file into the database you just made with this command (replace <dumpfile.sql> with the actual file):
    
    mysql -u root -p hbtn_0d_tvshows < <dumpfile.sql>
 
 5. Now check your work! Re-enter mysql and run this command:
    
    SHOW databases; //your new database should be in this list
    USE hbtn_0d_tvshows; 
    SHOW tables; //you should see three tables: tvshows, tvshow_genres and tv_genres
 
 6. Play with em!
